      THE PHANTOM OF BOGUE HOLAUBA
    </h1>
    <h2>
      By Charles Egbert Craddock <br /> <br /> 1911
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Gordon never forgot the sensation he experienced on first beholding it.
      There was no mist in the midnight. The moon was large and low. The
      darkness of the dense, towering forests on either hand impinged in no wise
      on the melancholy realm of wan light in which the Mississippi lay,
      unshadowed, solitary, silent as always, its channel here a mile or more in
      breadth.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been observing how the mighty water-course was sending out its
      currents into a bayou, called Bogue Holauba, as if the larger stream were
      a tributary of the lesser. This peculiarity of the river in the deltaic
      region, to throw off volume instead of continually receiving affluents,
      was unaccustomed to him, being a stranger to the locality, and for a
      moment it focussed his interest The next, his every faculty was
      concentrated on a singular phenomenon on the bank of the bogue.
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught his breath with a gasp; then, without conscious volition, he
      sought to explain it to his own shocked senses, to realize it as some
      illusion, some combination of natural causes, the hour, the pallor
      pervading the air, the distance, for his boat was near the middle of the
      stream,&mdash;but the definiteness of the vision annulled his efforts.
    </p>
    <p>
      There on the broad, low margin, distinct, yet with a coercive conviction
      of unreality, the figure of a man drawn in lines of vague light paced
      slowly to and fro; an old man, he would have said, bent and wizened,
      swaying back and forth, in expressive contortions, a very pantomime of
      woe, wringing gaunt hands and arms above his head, and now and again
      bowing low in recurrent paroxysms of despair. The wind held its breath,
      and the river, mute as ever, made no sign, and the encompassing alluvial
      wilderness stood for a type of solitude. Only the splashing of the paddle
      of the &ldquo;dug-out&rdquo; gave token of the presence of life in all the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gordon could not restrain his wonder. &ldquo;What&mdash;what&mdash;is&mdash;that
      Thing&mdash;over there on the bank of the bogue?&rdquo; he called out to the
      negro servant who was paddling the canoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was all unprepared for the effect of his words. Indeed, he was fain to
      hold hard to the gunwales. For the negro, with a sudden galvanic start,
      let slip the paddle from his hand, recovering it only by a mighty lunge in
      a mechanical impulse of self-preservation. The dug-out, the most tricksy
      craft afloat, rocked violently in the commotion and threatened to capsize.
      Then, as it finally righted, its course was hastily changed, and under the
      impetus of panic terror it went shooting down the river at a tremendous
      speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what does all this meant&rdquo; demanded Gordon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't ye talk ter me, boss!&rdquo; the boatman, with chattering teeth, adjured
      his passenger. &ldquo;Don't ye talk ter me, boss! Don't tell me ye seed somepin
      over dar on Bogue Holauba&mdash;'kase ef ye <i>do</i> I'se gwine ter turn
      dis dug-out upside down an' swim out ter de Arkansas side. I ain't gwine
      ter paddle dis boat fur no ghost-seer, sure 's ye are born. I ain't gwine
      ter have no traffickin' wid ghosts nur ghost-seers nuther. I'd die 'fore
      de year's out, sure!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sincerity of the servant's fright was attested by the change in his
      manner. He had been hitherto all cheerful, though respectful, affability,
      evidently bidding high for a tip. Now he crouched disconsolate and sullen
      in his place, wielding the paddle with all his might, and sedulously
      holding down his head, avoiding the stranger's eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gordon felt the whole situation in some sort an affront to his dignity,
      and the apparition being withdrawn from view by the changed direction, he
      was in better case to take account of this,&mdash;to revolt at the uncouth
      character of the craft and guide sent for him; the absence of any member
      of his entertainers family to welcome the visitor, here at their instance
      and invitation; the hour of the night; the uncanny incident of the
      inexplicable apparition,&mdash;but when that thought recurred to him he
      sheered off precipitately from the recollection.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had the salutary effect of predisposing him to make the best of the
      situation. Being to a degree a man of the world and of a somewhat large
      experience, he began to argue within himself that he could scarcely have
      expected a different reception in these conditions. The great river being
      at the stage known as &ldquo;dead low water,&rdquo; steamboat travel was practically
      suspended for the season, or he could have reached his destination more
      directly than by rail. An accident had delayed the train some seven hours,
      and although the gasoline launch sent to meet him at the nearest
      way-station had been withdrawn at nightfall, since he did not arrive, as
      his sable attendant informed him, the dug-out had been substituted, with
      instructions to wait all night, on the remote chance that he might come,
      after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, it was with an averse, disaffected gaze that he silently
      watched the summit-line of foliage on either bank of the river glide
      slowly along the sky, responsive to the motion of the boat. It seemed a
      long monotony of this experience, as he sat listless in the canoe, before
      a dim whiteness began to appear in a great, unbroken expanse in the
      gradually enlarging riparian view&mdash;the glister of the moon on the
      open cotton-bolls in the fields. The forests were giving way, the region
      of swamp and bayou. The habitations of man were at hand, and when at last
      the dug-out was run in to a plantation landing, and Kenneth Gordon was
      released from his cramped posture in that plebeian craft, he felt so
      averse to his mission, such a frivolous, reluctant distaste that he
      marvelled how he was to go through with it at all, as he took his way
      along the serpentine curves of the &ldquo;dirt road,&rdquo; preceded by his guide,
      still with eyes averted and sullen mien, silently bearing his suit-case.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few turns, and suddenly a large house came into view, rearing its white
      facade to the moonlight in the midst of a grove of magnolia trees, immense
      of growth, the glossy leaves seeming a-drip with lustre as with dew. The
      flight of steps and the wide veranda were here cumbered with potted ferns
      and foliage plants as elsewhere, and gave the first suggestion of
      conformity to the ways of the world that the adventure had yet borne. The
      long, broad, silent hall into which he was ushered, lighted only by a
      kerosene hand-lamp which the servant carried as he led the way, the stairs
      which the guest ascended in a mansion of unconscious strangers, all had
      teerie intimations, and the comfort and seclusion of the room assigned to
      Gordon was welcome indeed to him; for, argue as he might, he was conscious
      of a continuous and acute nervous strain. He had had a shock, he was
      irritably aware, and he would be glad of rest and quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a large, square, comfortable room in one of the wings, overlooking
      a garden, which sent up a delectable blend of fragrance and dew through
      the white muslin curtains at the long, broad windows, standing open to the
      night. On a table, draped with the inevitable &ldquo;drawn-work&rdquo; of
      civilization, stood a lamp of finer fashion, but no better illuminating
      facilities, than the one carried off by the darky, who had made great
      haste to leave the room, and who had not lifted his eyes toward the
      ill-omened &ldquo;ghost-seer&rdquo; nor spoken a word since Gordon had blurted out his
      vision on Bogue Holauba. This table also bore a tray with crackers and
      sandwiches and a decanter of sherry, which genially intimated hospitable
      forethought. The bed was a big four-poster, which no be-dizenment could
      bring within the fashion of the day. Gordon had a moment's poignant recoil
      from the darkness, the strangeness, the recollection of the inexplicable
      apparition he had witnessed, as his head sank on the pillow, embroidered
      after the latest fads.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could see through the open window that the moon was down at last and
      the world abandoned to gloom. He heard from out some neighboring swamp the
      wild lamenting cry of the crane; and then, listen as he might, the night
      had lapsed to silence, and the human hearts in this house, all unknown to
      him, were as unimagined, as unrelated, as unresponsive, as if instead of a
      living, breathing home he lay in some mute city of the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment, as it seemed, a sky as richly azure as the boasted
      heavens of Italy filled his vision as he lifted himself on his elbow. A
      splendid, creamy, magnolia bloom was swaying in the breeze, almost
      touching the window-sill. There was a subdued, respectful knocking at the
      door, which Gordon had a vague idea that he had heard before this morning,
      preceding the announcement that breakfast was waiting. Tardily mindful of
      his obligations as guest, he made all the speed possible in his toilet,
      and soon issued into the hall, following the sound of voices through the
      open doors, which led him presently to the threshold of the
      breakfast-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were two ladies at the table, one of venerable aspect, with short,
      white curls, held from her face by side-combs, a modish breakfast-cap, and
      a morning-gown of thin gray silk. The other was young enough to be her
      daughter, as indeed she was, dressed in deep mourning. Rising instantly
      from her place as hostess behind the silver service, she extended her hand
      to the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Gordon, is it not? I was afraid you would arrive during the night.
      Mercy! So uncomfortable! How good of you to come&mdash;yes, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sank into her chair again, pressing her black-bordered handkerchief to
      her dark eyes, which seemed to Gordon singularly dry, round, and glossy&mdash;suggestive
      of chestnuts, in fact. &ldquo;So good of you to come,&rdquo; she repeated, &ldquo;to the
      house of mourning! Very few people have any talent for woe, Mr. Gordon.
      These rooms have housed many guests, but not to weep with us. The stricken
      deer must weep alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She fell to hysterical sobbing, which her mother interrupted by a
      remonstrant &ldquo;My dear, my dear!&rdquo; A blond young man with a florid cheek and
      a laughing blue eye, who sat in an easy posture at the foot of the table,
      aided the diversion of interest &ldquo;Won't you introduce me, Mrs. Keene?&mdash;or
      must I take the opportunity to tell Mr. Gordon that I am Dr. Rigdon, very
      much at his service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy! yes, yes, indeed!&rdquo; Mrs. Keene acceded as the two young men shook
      hands; then, evidently perturbed by her lack of ceremony, she exclaimed
      pettishly, &ldquo;Where is Geraldine? She always sees to it that everybody knows
      everybody, and that everybody is served at a reception or a tea. I never
      have to think of such things if <i>she</i> is in the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The allusions seemed to Gordon a bit incongruous with the recent heavy
      affliction of the household. The accuracy with which the waves of red
      hair, of a rich tint that suggested chemicals, undulated about the brow of
      the widow, the art with which the mourning-gown brought out all the best
      points and subdued the defects of a somewhat clumsy figure, the suspicion
      of a cosmetic's aid in a dark line, scarcely perceptible yet amply
      effective, under the prominent eyes, all contributed to the determination
      of a lady of forty-five years of age to look thirty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Geraldine is always late for breakfast, but surely she ought to be down
      by this time,&rdquo; Mrs. Brinn said, with as much acrimony as a mild old lady
      could well compass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Geraldine reads half the night,&rdquo; explained Mrs. Keene. &ldquo;Such an
      injurious habit! Don't you think so, Mr. Gordon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, <i>she</i> is all right,&rdquo; expostulated the young physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Geraldine has a constitution of iron, I know,&rdquo; Mrs. Keene admitted. &ldquo;But,
      mercy!&mdash;to live in books, Mr. Gordon. Now, <i>I</i> always wanted to
      live in life,&mdash;in the world! I used to tell Mr. Keene&rdquo;&mdash;even she
      stumbled a trifle in naming the so recent dead. &ldquo;I used to tell him that
      he had buried the best years of my life down here in the swamp on the
      plantation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pleasant for Mr. Keene,&rdquo; Gordon thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to live in life,&rdquo; reiterated Mrs. Keene. &ldquo;What is a glimpse of
      New Orleans or the White Sulphur Springs once in a great while!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'This world is but a fleeting show,'&rdquo; quoted Rigdon, with a palpable
      effort to laugh off the inappropriate subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that is what people always tell the restricted, especially when they
      are themselves drinking the wine-cup to the bottom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And finding the lees bitter,&rdquo; said Rigdon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The widow gave an offhand gesture. &ldquo;You learned that argument from
      Geraldine&mdash;he is nothing but an echo of Geraldine, Mr. Gordon&mdash;now,
      isn't he, Mamma?&rdquo; she appealed directly to Mrs. Brinn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seems to have a great respect for Geraldine's opinion,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Brinn primly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I may ask, who is this lady who seems to give the law to the
      community?&rdquo; inquired Gordon, thinking it appropriate to show, and really
      beginning to feel, an interest in the personnel of the entourage. &ldquo;Am I
      related to her, as well as to Mr. Keene?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; Geraldine is one of the Norris family&mdash;intimate friends of ours,
      but not relatives. She often visits here, and in my affliction and
      loneliness I begged her to come and stay for several weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not to be related to the all-powerful Geraldine was something of a
      disappointment, for although Gordon had little sentiment or ideality in
      his mental and moral system, one of his few emotional susceptibilities lay
      in his family pride and clannish spirit He felt for his own, and he was
      touched in his chief altruistic possibility in the appeal that had brought
      him hither. To his amazement, Mr. Keene, a second cousin whom he had
      seldom even seen, had named him executor of his will, without bond, and in
      a letter written in the last illness, reaching its destination indeed
      after the writer's death, had besought that Gordon would be gracious
      enough to act, striking a crafty note in urging the ties of consanguinity.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for this plea Gordon would have doubtless declined on the score of
      pressure of business of his own. There were no nearer relatives, however,
      and with a sense of obligation at war with a restive indisposition, Gordon
      had come in person to this remote region to offer the will for probate,
      and to take charge of the important papers and personal property of the
      deceased. A simple matter it would prove, he fancied. There was no great
      estate, and probably but few business complications.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going home, Dr. George?&rdquo; his hostess asked as the young physician made
      his excuses for quitting the table before the conclusion of the meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Bigdon is not staying in the house, then?&rdquo; Gordon queried as the door
      closed upon him, addressing the remark to the old lady by way of politely
      including her in the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he is a neighbor of ours&mdash;a close and constant friend to us.&rdquo;
       Mrs. Brinn spoke as with grateful appreciation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Keene took a different view. &ldquo;He just hangs about here on Geraldine's
      account,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He happens to be here today because last night she
      took a notion that he must go all the way to Bogue Holauba to meet you, if
      the train should stop at the station above; but he was called off to
      attend a severe case of ptomaine poisoning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did the man die?&rdquo; Mrs. Brinn asked, with a sort of soft awe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy! I declare I forgot to ask him if the man died or not,&rdquo; exclaimed
      Mrs. Keene. &ldquo;But that was the reason that only a servant was sent to meet
      you, Mr. Gordon. The doctor looked in this morning to learn if you had
      arrived safely, and we made him stay to breakfast with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gordon was regretting that he had let him depart so suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought perhaps, as he seems so familiar with the place he might show
      me where Mr. Keene kept his papers. I ought to have them in hand at once.&rdquo;
       Mrs. Keene remembered to press her handkerchief to her eyes, and Gordon
      hastily added, &ldquo;Since Dr. Big-don is gone, perhaps this lady&mdash;what is
      her name?&mdash;Geraldine&mdash;could save you the trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy, yes!&rdquo; she declared emphatically. &ldquo;For I really do not know where
      to begin to look. Geraldine will know or guess. I'll go straight and rouse
      Geraldine out of bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She preceded Gordon into the hall, and, flinging over her shoulder the
      admonition, &ldquo;Make yourself at home, I beg,&rdquo; ran lightly up the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Gordon strolled to the broad front door that stood open from
      morning to night, winter and summer, and paused there to light his cigar.
      All his characteristics were accented in the lustre of the vivid day,
      albeit for the most part they were of a null, negative tendency, for he
      had an inexpressive, impersonal manner and a sort of aloof, reserved
      dignity. His outward aspect seemed rather the affair of his up-to-date
      metropolitan tailor and barber than any exponent of his character and
      mind. He was not much beyond thirty years of age, and his straight, fine,
      dark hair was worn at the temples more by the fluctuations of stocks than
      the ravages of time. He was pale, of medium height, and slight of build;
      he listened with a grave, deliberate attention and an inscrutable gray
      eye, very steady, coolly observant, an appreciable asset in the brokerage
      business. He was all unaccustomed to the waste of time, and it was with no
      slight degree of impatience that he looked about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The magnolia grove filled the space to the half-seen gate in front of the
      house, but away on either side were long vistas. To the right the river
      was visible, and, being one of the great bends of the stream, it seemed to
      run directly to the west, the prospect only limited by the horizon line.
      On the other side, a glare, dazzlingly white in the sun, proclaimed the
      cotton-fields. Afar the gin-house showed, with its smoke-stack, like an
      obeliscal column, from which issued heavy coils of vapor, and occasionally
      came the raucous grating of a screw, telling that the baler was at work.
      Interspersed throughout the fields were the busy cotton-pickers, and now
      and again rose snatches of song as they heaped the great baskets in the
      turn-rows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the purlieus of the inclosure about the mansion there was no stir
      of industry, no sign of life, save indeed an old hound lying on the
      veranda steps, looking up with great, liquid, sherry-tinted eyes at the
      stranger, and, though wheezing a wish to lick his hand, unable to muster
      the energy to rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      After an interval of a few moments Gordon turned within. He felt that he
      must forthwith get at the papers and set this little matter in order. He
      paused baffled at the door of the parlor, where satin damask and rosewood
      furniture, lace curtains and drawn shades, held out no promise of
      repositories of business papers. On the opposite side of the hall was a
      sitting-room that bore evidence of constant use. Here was a desk of the
      old-fashioned kind, with a bookcase as a superstructure, and a
      writing-table stood in the centre of the floor, equipped with a number of
      drawers which were all locked, as a tentative touch soon told. He had not
      concluded its examination when a step and rustle behind him betokened a
      sudden entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Geraldine Norris!&rdquo; a voice broke upon the air,&mdash;a voice that he
      had not before heard, and he turned abruptly to greet the lady as she
      formally introduced herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      A veritable Titania she seemed as she swayed in the doorway. She was a
      little thing, delicately built, slender yet not thin, with lustrous golden
      hair, large, well-opened, dark blue eyes, a complexion daintily white and
      roseate,&mdash;a fairy-like presence indeed, but with a prosaic,
      matter-of-fact manner and a dogmatic pose of laying down the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gordon could never have imagined himself so disconcerted as when she
      advanced upon him with the caustic query, &ldquo;Why did you not ask Mrs. Keene
      for her husband's keys? Surely that is simple enough!&rdquo; She flung a bunch
      of keys on a steel ring down upon the table. &ldquo;Heavens! to be roused from
      my well-earned slumbers at daybreak to solve this problem! 'Hurryf Hurry!
      Hurry!'&rdquo; She mimicked Mrs. Keene's urgency, then broke out laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she demanded, all unaffected by his mien of surprised and offended
      dignity, &ldquo;do you think yourself equal to the task of fitting these keys,&mdash;or
      shall I lend you my strong right arm!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is to be doubted if Gordon had ever experienced such open ridicule as
      when she came smiling up to the table, drawing back the sleeve of her gown
      from her delicate dimpled wrist. She wore a white dress, such as one never
      sees save in that Southern country, so softly sheer, falling in such
      graceful, floating lines, with a deep, plain hem and no touch of garniture
      save, perhaps, an edge of old lace on the surplice neck. The cut of the
      dress showed a triangular section of her soft white chest and all the firm
      modelling of her throat and chin. It was evidently not a new gown, for a
      rent in one of the sleeves had been sewed up somewhat too obviously, anil
      there was a darn on the shoulder where a rose-bush had snagged the fabric.
      A belt of black velvet, with long, floating sash-ends, was about her
      waist, and a band of black velvet held in place her shining hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry to have been the occasion of disturbing you,&rdquo; he said with
      stiff formality, &ldquo;and I am very much obliged, certainly,&rdquo; he added, as he
      took up the keys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may consider myself dismissed from the presence?&rdquo; she asked saucily.
      &ldquo;Then, I will permit myself a cup of chocolate and a roll, and be ready
      for any further commands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She frisked out of the door, and, frowning heavily, he sat down to the
      table and opened the top-drawer, which yielded instantly to the first key
      that he selected.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first paper, too, on which he laid his hand was the will, signed and
      witnessed, regularly executed, all its provisions seeming, as he glanced
      through it, reasonable and feasible. As he laid it aside, he experienced
      the business man's satisfaction with a document duly capable of the ends
      desired. Then he opened with a sudden flicker of curiosity a bulky
      envelope placed with the will and addressed to himself. He read it
      through, the natural interest on his face succeeded by amazement,
      increasing gradually to fear, the chill drops starting from every pore. He
      had grown ghastly white before he had concluded the perusal, and for a
      long time he sat as motionless as if turned to stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The September day glowed outside in sumptuous splendor. A glad wind sprang
      up and sped afield. Geraldine, her breakfast finished, a broad hat canted
      down over her eyes, rushed through the hall as noisily as a boy, prodded
      up the old hound, and ran him a race around the semicircle of the drive. A
      trained hound he had been in his youth, and he was wont to conceal and
      deny certain ancient accomplishments. But even he realized that it was
      waste of breath to say nay to the persistent Geraldine. He resigned
      himself to go through all his repertoire,&mdash;was a dead dog, begged,
      leaped a stick back and forth, went lame, and in his newly awakened
      interest performed several tricks of which she had been unaware. Her
      joyful cries of commendation&mdash;&ldquo;Played an encore! <i>an encore!</i> He
      did, he did! Cutest old dog in the United States!&rdquo; caught Mrs. Keene's
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Geraldine,&rdquo; she screamed from an upper window, &ldquo;come in out of the sun!
      You will have a sun-stroke&mdash;and ruin your complexion besides! You
      know you ought to be helping that man with those papers,&mdash;he won't be
      able to do anything without you!&rdquo; Her voice quavered on the last words, as
      if she suddenly realized &ldquo;that man&rdquo; might overhear her,&mdash;as indeed he
      did. But he made no sign. He sat still, stultified and stony, silently
      gazing at the paper in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      When luncheon was announced, Gordon asked to have something light sent in
      to him, as he wished not to be disturbed in his investigation of the
      documents. He had scant need to apprehend interruption, however, while the
      long afternoon wore gradually away. The universal Southern siesta was on,
      and the somnolent mansion was like the castle of Sleeping Beauty. The
      ladies had sought their apartments and the downy couches; the cook, on a
      shady bench under the trellis, nodded as she seeded the raisins for the
      frozen pudding of the six-o'clock dinner; the waiter had succumbed in
      clearing the lunch-table and made mesmeric passes with the dish-rag in a
      fantasy of washing the plates; the stable-boy slumbered in the hay, high
      in the loft, while the fat old coachman, with a chamois-skin in his hand,
      dozed as he sat on the step of the surrey, between the fenders; the old
      dog snored on the veranda floor, and Mrs. Keene's special attendant, who
      was really more a seamstress than a ladies' maid, dreamed that for some
      mysterious reason she could not thread a needle to fashion in a vast hurry
      the second mourning of her employer, who she imagined would call for it
      within a week!
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the charmed precincts of this Castle Indolence, the busy
      cotton-pickers knew no pause nor stay. The steam-engine at the gin panted
      throughout all the long hot hours, the baler squealed and rasped and
      groaned, as it bound up the product into marketable compass, but there was
      no one waking near enough to note how the guest of the mansion was pacing
      the floor in a stress of nervous excitement, and to comment on the fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward sunset, a sudden commotion roused the slumbrous place. There had
      been an accident at the gin,&mdash;a boy had been caught in the machinery
      and variously mangled. Dr. George Eigdon had been called and had promptly
      sewed up the wounds. A runner had been sent to the mansion for bandages,
      brandy, fresh clothing, and sundry other collateral necessities of the
      surgery, and the news had thrown the house into unwonted excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The boy won't die, then?&rdquo; Geraldine asked of a second messenger, as he
      stood by the steps of the veranda, waiting for the desired commodities.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lawdy,&mdash;<i>no</i>, ma'am! He is as good as new! Doc' George, <i>he</i>
      fix him up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gordon, whom the tumult had summoned forth from his absorptions, noted
      Geraldine's triumphant laugh as she received this report, the toss of her
      spirited little head, the light in her dark blue eyes, deepening to
      sapphire richness, her obvious pride in the skill, the humanitarian
      achievement, of her lover. Dr. George must be due here this evening, he
      fancied. For she was all freshly bedight; her gown was embellished with
      delicate laces, and its faint green hue gave her the aspect of some
      water-sprite, posed against that broad expanse of the Mississippi River,
      that was itself of a jade tint reflected from a green and amber sky; at
      the low horizon line the vermilion sun was sinking into its swirling
      depths.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gordon perceived a personal opportunity in the prospect of this guest for
      the evening. He must have counsel, he was thinking. He could not act on
      his own responsibility in this emergency that had suddenly confronted him.
      He was still too overwhelmed by the strange experience he had encountered,
      too shaken. This physician was a man of intelligence, of skill in his
      chosen profession, necessarily a man worth while in many ways. He was an
      intimate friend of the Keene family, and might the more heartily lend a
      helping hand. The thought, the hope, cleared Gordon's brow, but still the
      impress of the stress of the afternoon was so marked that the girl was
      moved to comment in her brusque way as they stood together on the cool,
      fern-embowered veranda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mr. Gordon,&rdquo; she exclaimed in surprise, &ldquo;you have no idea how
      strange you look! You must have overworked awfully this afternoon. Why,
      you look as if you had seen a ghost!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To her amazement, he recoiled abruptly. Involuntarily, he passed his hand
      over his face, as if seeking to obliterate the traces she had deciphered.
      Then, with an obvious effort, he recovered a show of equanimity; he
      declared that it was only because he was so tousled in contrast with her
      fresh finery that she thought he looked supernaturally horrible! He would
      go upstairs forthwith and array himself anew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gordon proved himself a true prophet, for Rigdon came to dine. With the
      postprandial cigars, the two gentlemen, at Gordon's suggestion, repaired
      to the sitting-room to smoke, instead of joining their hostess on the
      veranda, where tobacco was never interdicted. Indeed, they did not come
      forth thence for nearly two hours, and were palpably embarrassed when
      Geraldine declared in bewilderment, gazing at them in the lamplight that
      fell from within, through one of the great windows, that now <i>both</i>
      looked as if they had seen a ghost!
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite their efforts to sustain the interest of the conversation, they
      were obviously distrait, and had a proclivity to fall into sudden
      silences, and Mrs. Keene found them amazingly unresponsive and dull. Thus
      it was that she rose as if to retire for the night while the hour was
      still early. In fact, she intended to utilize the opportunity to have some
      dresses of the first mourning outfit tried on, for which the patient maid
      was now awaiting her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I leave you a charming substitute,&rdquo; she said in making her excuses.
      &ldquo;Geraldine need not come in yet&mdash;it is not late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her withdrawal seemed to give a fresh impetus to some impulse with which
      Rigdon had been temporizing. He recurred to it at once. &ldquo;You contemplate
      giving it to the public,&rdquo; he said to Gordon; &ldquo;why not try its effect on a
      disinterested listener first, and judge from that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gordon assented with an extreme gravity that surprised Geraldine; then
      Rigdon hesitated, evidently scarcely knowing how to begin. He looked
      vaguely at the moon riding high in the heavens above the long, broad
      expanse of the Mississippi and the darkling forests on either hand.
      Sometimes a shaft of light, a sudden luminous glister, betokened the
      motion of the currents gliding in the sheen. &ldquo;Last night,&rdquo; he said in a
      tense, bated voice&mdash;&ldquo;last night Mr. Gordon saw the phantom of Bogue
      Holauba, Stop! Hush!&rdquo;&mdash;for the girl had sprung half screaming from
      her chair. &ldquo;This is important.&rdquo; He laid his hand on her arm to detain her.
      &ldquo;We want you to help us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help you! Why, you scare me to death!&rdquo; She had paused, but stood
      trembling from head to foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is something explained in one of Mr. Keene's papers,&mdash;addressed
      to Mr. Gordon; and we have been much startled by the coincidence of his&mdash;his
      vision.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he see&mdash;really&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; Geraldine had sunk back in her
      chair, her face ghastly pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it must be some illusion,&rdquo; said Rigdon. &ldquo;The effect of the
      mist, perhaps&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only, there was no mist,&rdquo; said Gordon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps a snag waving in the wind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only, there was no wind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps a snag tossing in the motion of the water,&mdash;at all events,
      you can't say there was no water.&rdquo; Dr. Rigdon glanced at Gordon with a
      genial smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mighty little water for the Mississippi,&rdquo; Gordon sought to respond in the
      same key.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know the record of these apparitions.&rdquo; Leaning forward, one arm on
      his knee, the document in question in his hand, Rigdon looked up into
      Geraldine's pale face. &ldquo;In the old days there used to be a sort of
      water-gypsy, with a queer little trading-boat that plied the region of the
      bends&mdash;a queer little old man, too&mdash;Polish, I think, foreign
      certainly&mdash;and the butt of all the wags alongshore, at the stores and
      the wood-yards, the cotton-sheds and the wharf-boats. By some accident, it
      was thought, the boat got away when he was befuddled with drink in a
      wood-chopper's cabin&mdash;a stout, trig little craft it was! When he
      found it was gone, he was wild, for although he saw it afloat at a
      considerable distance down the Mississippi, it suddenly disappeared near
      Bogue Holauba, cargo and all. No trace of its fate was ever discovered. He
      haunted these banks then&mdash;whatever he may have done since&mdash;screaming
      out his woes for his losses, and his rage and curses on the miscreants who
      had set the craft adrift&mdash;for he fully believed it was done in malice&mdash;beating
      his breast and tearing his hair. The Civil War came on presently, and the
      man was lost sight of in the national commotions. No one thought of him
      again till suddenly something&mdash;an apparition, an illusion, the
      semblance of a man&mdash;began to patrol the banks of Bogue Holauba, and
      beat its breast and tear its hair and bewail its woes in pantomime, and
      set the whole country-side aghast, for always disasters follow its
      return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how do you account for that phase?&rdquo; asked Gordon, obviously steadying
      his voice by an effort of the will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The apparition always shows up at low water,&mdash;the disasters are
      usually typhoid,&rdquo; replied the physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Keene died from malaria,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Geraldine murmured musingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men glanced significantly at each other. Then Rigdon resumed: &ldquo;I
      mustered the hardihood on one occasion to row up to the bank of Bogue
      Holauba for a closer survey. The thing vanished on my approach. There was
      a snag hard by, fast anchored in the bottom of the Bogue. It played
      slackly to and fro with the current, but I could not see any way by which
      it or its shadow could have produced the illusion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this what you had to tell me?&rdquo; demanded Geraldine pertinently. &ldquo;I knew
      all that already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; replied the Doctor reluctantly. &ldquo;Will you tell it, Mr. Gordon,
      or shall I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, by all means, if you will,&rdquo; said Gordon gloomily. &ldquo;God knows I
      should be glad never to speak of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Rigdon began slowly, &ldquo;Mr. Gordon was made by his cousin Jasper
      Keene not only the executor of his will, but the repository of a certain
      confession, which he may destroy or make public as he sees proper. It
      seems that in Mr. Keene's gay young days, running wild in his vacation
      from college on a secluded plantation, he often lacked congenial
      companionship, and he fell in with an uncouth fellow of a lower social
      grade, who led him into much detrimental adventure. Among other incidents
      of very poor fun, the two were notable in hectoring and guying the old
      Polish trader, who, when drunk on mean whisky as he often was, grew
      violent and antagonistic. He went very far in his denunciations one fatal
      night, and by way of playing him a trick in return, they set his boat
      adrift by cutting the rope that tied the craft to a tree on the bank. The
      confession states that they supposed the owner was then aboard and would
      suffer no greater hardship than having to use the sweeps with considerable
      energy to row her in to a landing again. They were genuinely horrified
      when he came running down the bank, both arms out-stretched, crying out
      that his all, <i>his all</i> was floating away on that tumultutius,
      merciless tide. Before any skiff could be launched, before any effort
      could be made to reach the trading-boat, she suddenly disappeared. The
      Mississippi was at flood height, and it was thought that the boat struck
      some drifting obstruction, swamped, and went down in deep water. The
      agents in this disaster were never suspected, but as soon as Jasper Keene
      had come of age, and had command of any means of his own, his first act
      was to have an exhaustive search made for the old fellow, with a view of
      financial restitution. But the owner of the trading-boat had died,
      spending his last years in the futile effort to obtain the insurance
      money. As the little he had left was never claimed, no representative
      could profit by the restitution that Jasper Keene had planned, and he
      found what satisfaction he could in giving it secretly to an old man's
      charity. Then the phantom began to take his revenge. He appeared on the
      banks of Bogue Holauba, and straightway the only child of the mansion
      sickened and died. Mr. Keene's first wife died after the second
      apparition. Either it was the fancy of an ailing man, or perhaps the
      general report, but he notes that the spectre was bewailing its woes along
      the banks of Bogue Holauba when Jasper Keene himself was stricken by an
      illness which from the first he felt was fatal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember&mdash;I remember it was said at the time,&rdquo; Geraldine barely
      whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now to the question: he leaves it to Mr. Gordon as his kinsman,
      solicitous of the family repute, to judge whether this confession should
      be made public or destroyed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he state any reasons for making it public?&rdquo; demanded Geraldine,
      taking the document and glancing through its pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; as an expiation of his early misdeeds toward this man and, if any
      such thing there be, to placate the spirit of his old enemy; and lastly
      better to secure his peace with his Maker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And which do you say!&rdquo; Geraldine turned an eager, spirited face toward
      Gordon, his dejected attitude and countenance distinctly seen in the light
      from the lamp within the parlor, on a table close to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I frankly admit that the publication of that confession would humiliate
      me to the ground, but I fear that it <i>ought</i> to be given to the
      public, as he obviously desires!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And which do <i>you</i> say!&rdquo; Geraldine was standing now, and swiftly
      whirled around toward Dr. Bigdon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree with Mr. Gordon&mdash;much against my will&mdash;but an honest
      confession is good for the soul!&rdquo; he, replied ruefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You infidels!&rdquo; she exclaimed tumultuously. &ldquo;You have not one atom of
      Christian faith between you! To imagine that <i>you</i> can strike a
      bargain with the good God by letting a sick theory of expiation of a
      dying, fever-distraught creature besmirch his repute as a man and a
      gentleman, make his whole life seem like a whited sepulchre, and bring his
      name into odium,&mdash;as kind a man as ever lived,&mdash;and you know it!&mdash;as
      honest, and generous, and whole-souled, to be held up to scorn and
      humiliation because of a boyish prank forty years ago, that precipitated a
      disaster never intended,&mdash;bad enough, silly enough, even wicked
      enough, but not half so bad and silly and wicked as <i>you</i>, with your
      morbid shrinking from moral responsibility, and your ready contributive
      defamation of character. Tell me, you men, is this a testamentary paper,
      and you think it against the law to destroy it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, not that,&rdquo; said Bigdon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is wholly optional,&rdquo; declared Gordon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, I will settle the question for you once for all, you wobblers!&rdquo; She
      suddenly thrust the paper into the chimney of the lamp on the table just
      within the open window, and as it flared up she flung the document forth,
      blazing in every fibre, on the bare driveway below the veranda. &ldquo;And now
      you may find, as best you can, some other means of exorcising the phantom
      of Bogue Holauba!&rdquo;
